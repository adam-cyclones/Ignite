# Ignite

Ignite Framework is for building lean JavaScript library bundles which run in the ForgeRock Identity Cloud, Ignite provides a whole mass of useful programming helpers and patches (known as fuel) to aid and improve the development experience of ForgeRock Identity Cloud decision nodes and Rhino.js, Ignite also ships a deployment CLI to help you target a script and deploy your bundle exactly where you need it, dependencies are inlined minified and optimized so you only get the libraries you need.
